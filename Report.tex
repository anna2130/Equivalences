What is the problem, why is it interesting and whatâ€™s your main idea for solving it?

\section{Motivation} 
All logics are based on propositional logic in some form, so it's important that new students learn how to use it. Propositional logic consists of syntax, semantics and proof theory. Syntax is the formal lanuage that is used to express concepts, semantics provide meaning for the language and proof theory provides a way to convert one formula into another using a defined set of rules.
\\\\
We know that new students learning propositional logic can struggle to understand the rules and how they should be applied to formulae. To help with this our idea is to create an equivalence teaching tool, this will be a tablet application that will allows a user to apply rules to a formula until they have reached the required equivalence.

\section{Approach}

We decided early in the project that the tool should be an android tablet application as this allows for an intuitive, interactive design while still having a large screen space.
\\\\
The tool can be devided up into it's main component parts: the parser, the rule generator and tablet interface. The parser will be generated by the ANTLR4 parser generator and the rule generator and tablet interface will be written in Java using the Android SDK.
\\\\
The parser will ...
\\\\
The goal of the rule generator is not only to generate rules to apply to the current formula but to also determine the optimal numSber of rules to complete the equivalence. This will be used in for generating equivalences, helping the user and spotting mistakes.
\\\\
The interface will have an intuitive design displaying the current formula as it's formation tree and allowing a user to click on the operators to apply a rule. This tree structure will be created by ...

\section{Contributions}

The application should have some key features, these are outlined below:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Graphical tree representation of formulae
\\\\Representing the formula as a tree structure allows a user to see exactly how the formula should be read and can help understanding of the order of operations. It also allows the user to click on an operator to select a rule for it which is much more intuative than just clicking on the whole formula and then selecting a section.

\item Undo/Redo functionality
\\\\(Add diagram)
\\\\Previous equivalent formulae will be displayed above the current formula. When an old formula is selected it will expand into tree form and the formulae below it are faded out (Undo). This allows a user to then perform rules on the old tree or select one of the later faded trees (Redo). When a rule is applied the faded formulae will then be removed from the history allowing the user to continue on from that previous point.

\item Generated equivalences
\\\\We allow the user to have equivalences automatically generated for them to solve. This is implemented by running the tool on a generated to give a significantly different equivalent one. The key advantage of having this feature as well as allowing manual entry of equivalences is that the user will have a continuous supply of new equivalent logic formulae after completing all those set by their lecturer. This also requires generating the initial formula for the tool to be run upon or to allow the user to manually enter the first formula and have the second one generated for them.

\item Difficulty setting
\\\\Extending the idea of generated equivalences we allow the user to select a difficulty. This is calculated by the length of the generated formula and how many rules were applied to get its equivalent formula. We also provide a recommended difficulty based on how many previous equivalences they have completed and how far from optimal their solutions were.

\item Help
\\\\Providing the user with help is key their improvement. Once an equivalence has been set up the tool calculates the optimal route from the start formula to the end. Upon finishing the equivalence the user will recieve a message telling them how far from the optimal solution they were and give them the option to try again or to view the optimal solution. Throughout there is also a help button available that will suggest the next step to the user on request, this includes the recommendation to undo certain steps if the user will reach a cycle. Pointing out mistakes can also be enabled, so if the user has completed a cycle or is heading towards a dead end they will be prompted that they should consider a different strategy.
